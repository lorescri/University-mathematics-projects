## Numerical Methods of ODEs

Welcome to the "Numerical Methods of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)" repository!

In this repository, you will find a collection of assigments made by my colleague **Nicole** and me, related to the course. The primary focus of the course
is on using the mathematical software "Wolfram Mathematica", as both a Computer Algebra System (CAS) and a programming language, with a strong emphasis on functional programming techniques.

### Topics Covered

I explore a wide range of mathematical topics through the development and application of programs, including:

- Prime number distribution
- Cryptographic methods (substitution, Hill, RSA)
- Self-similarity and fractal sets (Cantor sets, Koch curve, etc.)
- Iterated Function Systems
- Julia and Mandelbrot sets
- Fractal landscapes, fractal and Box Counting dimensions
- Numerical integration of ordinary differential equations and simple problems in Dynamical Systems
- An introduction to chaotic phenomena in dynamical systems; numerical measurement of the Lyapunov exponent
- 3D graphics: anaglyphs
- The Sierpi≈Ñski triangle and carpet


Please feel free to explore the content of this repository, where you'll find code and exercises related to the course. We hope you find these materials helpful in your study of numerical methods for ODEs. If you have any questions or suggestions, don't hesitate to reach out.
