## Numerical Methods of ODEs

Welcome to the "Numerical Methods of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)" repository!

In this repository, you will find a collection of assigments made by my colleague Nicole and me, related to the course. The primary focus of the course
is on using the mathematical software "Wolfram Mathematica", as both a Computer Algebra System (CAS) and a programming language, with a strong emphasis on functional programming techniques.

### Topics Covered

I explore a wide range of mathematical topics through the development and application of programs, including:

- Prime number distribution
- Cryptographic methods (substitution, Hill, RSA)
- Self-similarity and fractal sets (Cantor sets, Koch curve, etc.)
- Iterated Function Systems
- Julia and Mandelbrot sets
- Fractal landscapes, fractal and Box Counting dimensions
- Numerical integration of ordinary differential equations and simple problems in Dynamical Systems
- An introduction to chaotic phenomena in dynamical systems; numerical measurement of the Lyapunov exponent
- 3D graphics: anaglyphs
- The Sierpi≈Ñski triangle and carpet

### Main project: Exploring Misiurewich Points, the Mandelbrot Set, and the Julia Set
This repository includes also the final project of the course, which represents an exciting journey through three key concepts in fractal theory and complex mathematics. We will explore, analyze, and visualize the details behind Misiurewich Points, the Mandelbrot Set, and the Julia Set, revealing their astonishing patterns, symmetries, and properties.

The first part of the project consists of studying the **Misiurewich Points**, that are an intriguing mathematical set found in the realm of complex numbers. In this project , you will discover how these points relate to the theory of fractals and explore their unique mathematical properties.

The **Mandelbrot Set** is one of the most iconic fractals in mathematics. In the project, my colleague and I investigated its structure, generating stunning visual representations that unveil the remarkable details of this set and its relationship with complex numbers.

On the other hand, the **Julia Set** is another exciting concept in fractal theory. We analyze its characteristics and explore the multiple variations that can arise when exploring the Julia Set in different regions of the complex plane.

Throughout the project, we will employ powerful **visualization** and programming tools to graphically represent these sets and reveal their mathematical beauty. The generated images will provide a new perspective on these concepts and highlight their astonishing complexity.

I am thrilled to share this project with you and to explore together the wonderful intersection of mathematics, art, and computation. I hope you enjoy this experience as much as we did creating it!

If you have questions, comments, or wish to delve deeper into any of these concepts, please do not hesitate to get in touch. Thank you for joining me on this exciting mathematical journey!
