 ## Main project: Exploring Misiurewich Points, the Mandelbrot Set, and the Julia Set
This repository includes also the final project of the course, which represents an exciting journey through three key 
concepts in fractal theory and complex mathematics. My collegue Nicole and I explore, analyze, and visualize the details behind Misiurewich Points, the Mandelbrot Set, and the Julia Set, revealing their astonishing patterns, symmetries, and properties.

### Misiurewich Points

The first part of the project consists of studying the **Misiurewich Points**, that are an intriguing mathematical 
set found in the realm of complex numbers. In this project , you will discover how these points relate to the theory of
fractals and explore their unique mathematical properties.

### Mandelbrot Set

The **Mandelbrot Set** is one of the most iconic fractals in mathematics. In the project,we investigated its structure, generating stunning visual representations that unveil the remarkable details of this set and its relationship with complex numbers.

### Julia Set

On the other hand, the **Julia Set** is another exciting concept in fractal theory. We analyze its characteristics and explore the multiple variations that can arise when exploring the Julia Set in different regions of the complex plane.

### Visual Exploration

Throughout the project, we employ powerful **visualization** and programming tools to graphically represent these sets and reveal their mathematical beauty. The generated images will provide a new perspective on these concepts and highlight their astonishing complexity.
