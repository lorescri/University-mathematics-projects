# My University Career Projects

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Here, you'll find a collection of computer projects I've worked on throughout my university career. These projects cover a wide range of topics and demonstrate the computer skills and knowledge I have acquired during my academic career.

## Repository Contents

This repository contains a diverse range of **Computer Science Projects** with code samples, algorithms, and software development assignments, including programs in

- **MATLAB**: for development and theoretical and practical foundations of numerical algorithms for solving problems arising from scientific applications in a computational environment.
- **RStudio**: to study the Multiple Linear Regression Analysis, Principal Component Analysis and Discriminant Analysis.
- **FreeFem**: to work on various Numerical and Variational Methods of Partial Differential Equations. In particular the finite element method, which gives rise to the creation of creative projects such as the simulation of the vibration of the skin of a drum.
- **Excel**: to approach and solve challenging optimisation problems. 
- **Wolfram Mathematica**: used to undertake projects such as encryption, artificial landscape design, the study of Mandelbrot and Julia sets... And thanks to the program's intuitive comment function, you can find clear and detailed explanations of the commands used in these projects!

## Purpose

I've created this repository not only to store and organize my work but also to share my progress and learning experiences with others. Feel free to explore the projects and provide feedback or collaborate on any interesting ideas. Your insights and suggestions are highly appreciated.

Thank you for visiting, and I hope you find these projects informative and inspiring. If you have any questions or would like to get in touch, please don't hesitate to reach out. 

Happy coding and learning!
