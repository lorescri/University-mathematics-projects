# Numerical Calculus - Exploring the World of Nonlinear Equations and Computational Solutions

Welcome to the realm of Numerical Calculus, where I numerically 
solve nonlinear equations, with a special focus on polynomial equations, function interpolation, and numerical 
differentiation and integration. This section is dedicated to providing the practical 
skills for implementing numerical algorithms in a computational environment, addressing scientific applications.

##
This section includes a file in which I demonstrate the skills learnt during this university course.
