## Tackling Numerical Problems with MATLAB

In this section, I present the exercises practiced during 
the Numerical Calculus course. Here, you'll find a collection of assignments and problems that provide practical
insights into numerical methods, approximation, and mathematical problem-solving.

In this folder you will find:

1. **Practical exercises**: Each comes with detailed instructions and a clear explanation of the solutioins.
2. **Numerical Library**: In addition to the exercises, this repository includes a Numerical Library used during the course. This
 folder includes a collection of useful functions for numerical analysis, designed to assist in numerical calculations
and problem solving.
3. **Final assessment**: a final exercise of the course to assess the ability to solve numerical problems.

##
Feel free to explore the exercises and use the numerical library to enhance your understanding of Numerical Calculus.
Happy learning!
