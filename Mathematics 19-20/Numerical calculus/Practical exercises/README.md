## Tackling Numerical Problems with MATLAB

In this section, I present the exercises practiced during 
the Numerical Calculus course. Here, you'll find a collection of assignments and problems that provide practical
insights into numerical methods, approximation, and mathematical problem-solving.

In this folder you will find:

1. Some **practical exercises**, each comes with detailed statements and a clear explanation of the solutions. These exercises are devoted to the development of numerical algorithms for the resolution  of problems, in a computational environment, with a particular emphasis on the stability, accuracy, efficiency and robustness of the designed algorithms.
2. In addition to the exercises, this repository includes a **numerical library** used during the course. This
folder includes a collection of useful functions designed to assist in numerical calculations and problem solving.
3. And my **final assessment** of the course, to assess my ability to solve numerical problems.

##
Feel free to explore the exercises and use the numerical library to enhance your understanding of Numerical Calculus tasks.
Happy learning!
