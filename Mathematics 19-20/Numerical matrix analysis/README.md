## Matrix Numerical Analysis Applications: Hands-on with MATLAB

During the numerical matrix analysis course, I dealt with the numerical resolution of systems of linear equations,
the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrices and their applications to approximation problems
and the resolution of systems of non-linear equations.
