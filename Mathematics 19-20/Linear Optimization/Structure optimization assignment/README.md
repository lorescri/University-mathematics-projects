# Beam and Cable System Load Maximization

Welcome to the Load Maximization Exercise! The main goal is to maximize the total load capacity of a cable and beam system while respecting the conditions associated with the capacity of each cable.

## The Challenge: Load Maximization

Imagine a scenario where a multi-component structure, comprising beams and cables, needs to support as much weight as possible. However, there's a catch â€“ each cable has a specific weight-bearing capacity. How can we determine the most effective cable and load arrangement on the beams to maximize the overall load capacity of the system?

## The tools used

The tools used to tackle this problem are **Xpress** and **Microsoft Excel**. With these tools, we will transform data into actionable insights, creating mathematical models to guide decision-making.
