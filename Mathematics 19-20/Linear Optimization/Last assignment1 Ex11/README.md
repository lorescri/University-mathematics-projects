# Profit Maximization with Excel and Xpress

Welcome to the world of optimization, where data and mathematics come together to enhance business success. In this exercise, we will maximise a company's profit taking into account plant-specific constraints.

## The Challenge: Striking a Balance

Picture this scenario: A multi-plant enterprise aims to achieve peak profitability while working within strict constraints. These constraints include adhering to the maximum production capacity for each plant, the storage capacity of each 
plant, meeting demand requirements, and ensuring equitable distribution of the additional production capacity among all plants.

## The tools used

Our resources include **Xpress** and **Microsoft Excel**. With these tools, we will transform data into actionable insights, creating mathematical models to guide decision-making.

## The Quest: Mathematical Precision

1. **Data Input**: Our journey begins with data input in `data.xlsx`. This serves as the foundation for our adventure.

2. **Model Development**: We turn to mathematical modeling, crafting a framework that accommodates constraints and objectives.

3. **Excel Application**: In `optimization_model.xlsx`, we work with formulas to convert data into potential profits.

4. **Optimization Process**: Using Excel Solver or Xpress, we finely tune our mathematical precision to maximize profit.

5. **Results Unveiled**: The culmination of our efforts is presented in `solution_report.xlsx`. Here, optimal production levels are disclosed, promising increased profit.
