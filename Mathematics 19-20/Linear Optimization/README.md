## Optimization projects
In this section, I dive into the world of optimizing linear functions with constraints, using essential methods to tackle real-world problems. Here you will discover two university projects in which I illustrate how linear optimisation provides effective and efficient solutions.

### Exercise 1: Maximizing Company Profits

The first challenge revolves around the optimization of a company's profits. I will demonstrate how linear optimization techniques empower businesses to make strategic decisions, maximizing profitability while considering a range of constraints and objectives.

### Exercise 2: Maximizing Load Capacity

In the second exercise, we delve into a structural engineering problem. The objective is to maximize the load capacity of a system composed of beams and cables. By optimizing the arrangement of cables and loads, we showcase the remarkable potential of linear optimization in crafting resilient and efficient structural solutions.
