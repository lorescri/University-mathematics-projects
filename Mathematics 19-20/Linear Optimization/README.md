# Linear Optimization Showcase
In this section, I address the optimization of linear functions with constraints, 
applying essential methods to solve real-world problems. Here, you'll find two projects that 
demonstrate how linear optimization translates into effective and efficient solutions.
Welcome to this optimization journey in my GitHub space!


### Exercise 1: Maximizing Company Profits

The first challenge involves maximizing the profits of a company. I'll show how linear optimization 
techniques can help a business make strategic decisions to achieve peak profitability while considering various 
constraints and objectives.

### Exercise 2: Maximizing Load Capacity

In the second exercise, I address a structural engineering problem.
The aim is to maximize the load capacity of a system of beams and cables. 
By optimising the arrangement of cables and loads, the power of linear optimisation in the design of 
robust and efficient structural solutions is demonstrated.
