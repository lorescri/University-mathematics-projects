# Profit Maximization with Excel and Xpress

Welcome to the world of optimization, where data and mathematics come together to enhance business success. In this exercise, we will maximise a company's profit taking into account plant-specific constraints.

## The Challenge: Maximising profits

Picture this scenario: A multi-plant enterprise aims to achieve peak profitability while working within strict constraints. These constraints include adhering to the maximum production capacity for each plant, the storage capacity of each 
plant, meeting demand requirements, and ensuring equitable distribution of the additional production capacity among all plants.

## The tools used

The tools used to tackle this problem are **Xpress** and **Microsoft Excel**. With these tools, we will transform data into actionable insights, creating mathematical models to guide decision-making.

This section includes:

1. **Optimization Explanation**: A PDF document called `Exercise_approach.pdf` that provides an approach to solving the exercise and enhances understanding.
2. **Data Input**: Our journey begins with data input in `Initialise_variables.txt`. In this file, the initial values are assigned to the variables.
3. **Model Development**: We turn to mathematical modeling, crafting a framework that accommodates constraints and objectives. This repository includes a file for Xpress software called `Production_Xpress.mos`, which formulates and solves the exercise, considering all the given conditions.
4. **Excel Application**: In `Production_Excel.xlsx`, the proposed exercise is presented and solved.
5. **Results**: Using Excel Solver or Xpress, we finely tune our mathematical precision to maximize profit.
