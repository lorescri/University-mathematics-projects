# University Projects and Assignments (2022 - 2023)

Welcome to this section of my GitHub repository, representing the culmination of my final year in the field of Mathematics!

## About the Repository

This repository is a compilation of the most remarkable assignments and computer projects of my last academic year.
I have also included my final thesis on Borwein integrals as well as some theoretical assignments in Riemannian Geometry. 

Here are the key aspects:

### Bachelor's Thesis: Borwein Integrals

My bachelor thesis focuses on the intriguing Borwein integrals. In it I explore the curious behaviour and properties of these unique integrals and their applications.  
You can find my research and analysis in the folder dedicated to this project.

### Multivariate Statistics

In this section I have included several projects dealing with the application of linear models for the prediction of variables,
principal component analysis for information reduction, and the differentiation between groups based on individual variable values.

### Numerical and Variational Methods of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)
This folder showcases my projects for the Numerical and Variational Methods of PDEs course, including practical applications of the Finite Element Method 
to solve elliptic problems in 2D and 3D spatial dimensions. Here are included projects and exercises
related to this field, which explores essential techniques for solving practical problems.

### Riemannian Geometry

This GitHub folder does not contain any computer projects but I decided to add it as it contains very relevant tasks related to Differential Manifolds,
Riemannian Manifolds and Riemannian Submanifolds,

This repository reflects my passionate commitment to mathematics and my desire to share the knowledge and experience gained throughout my final academic year.
If you are interested in any of these topics, I invite you to explore the content and learn alongside me.

Feel free to reach out if you have questions or comments about any of the projects presented here. Thank you for joining me on this exciting mathematical journey!
