## Multivariate Statistics

Welcome to my GitHub folder dedicated to Multivariate Statistics. Here, I've explored key concepts and techniques in multivariate data analysis, with a primary focus on three crucial topics:

### Multiple Linear Regression

In this section, I delve deep into Multiple Linear Regression, a powerful statistical method for modeling the relationship between multiple independent variables and a single dependent variable. I've explored its application, interpretation, and insights derived from analyzing complex relationships.

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

The study of Principal Component Analysis is a significant highlight in this repository. PCA is a fundamental tool for reducing the dimensionality of data, identifying patterns, and uncovering hidden structures. Through various projects, I've demonstrated its practical application in diverse domains.

### Discriminant Analysis

The section on Discriminant Analysis delves into the statistical technique used to distinguish between two or more groups based on several quantitative variables. I've explored the theory and application of this method, demonstrating its utility in classification problems.

Each subfolder includes the projects, code, and documentation related to these topics. Whether you're a student or professional in data science, statistics, or related fields, these resources provide valuable insights into multivariate statistical analysis.
