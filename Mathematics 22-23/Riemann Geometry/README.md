## Riemannian Geometry Assignments

This collection showcases the tasks completed as part of the Riemannian Geometry course. 
This folder does not include computational tasks; however, I have decided to add them because of their detailed explanation, 
which can be very useful to understand the subject and strengthen the knowledge of those who are taking a similar subject.

### Task 1: Exploring Differentiable Manifolds

In this task, I delve into the fundamental concepts of differential geometry. 
We start with topological manifolds, differentiable manifolds, and the notion of tangent spaces. 
Diffeomorphisms, vector fields, and differential forms play a crucial role in understanding the geometry of these manifolds.
The task introduces us to the world of tensors and their applications in this context.

### Task 2: Metrics and Curvature

The second task focuses on Riemannian manifolds, where we introduce the notion of a metric tensor.
The Levi-Civita connection and covariant derivatives are introduced, leading us to study the concept of geodesics and their properties. 
I also work on the concept of the Riemann curvature tensor and its components, such as sectional curvature, Ricci curvature,
and scalar curvature, are discussed. 

### Task 3: Submanifolds and Immersions

In the third task, I study submanifolds, their isometric embeddings, and related concepts. 
The task covers topics like hypersurfaces, tangent and normal fields, induced connections and isometric immersions,
The concept of  the second fundamental form,  
the Gauss equation and  minimal hypersurface is explored.
