## Numerical and Variational Methods for PDEs

Here, you'll find a collection of assignments, each exploring different aspects of solving PDEs using the Finite Element Method with FreeFEM.
Each of the tasks is implemented in Notepad++ and executed using FreeFEM, providing graphical representations of the programmed solutions. I have also included the exercise statements for each task.

Let's take a glimpse at each of the tasks:

### Task 1: Implicit Euler Method

The third task explores the Implicit Euler Method. By applying this time-stepping technique, I study the behavior of dynamic systems.
In particular, this task focuses on describing the vibrations of a drum skin at different times.


### Task 2: Heat Transfer Flow

The second task focuses on Heat Transfer Flow. I employ the Finite Element Method to analyze heat transfer processes, specifically the distribution 
of temperature in a given domain. This task offers insights into heat conduction, crucial in engineering and physics.


### Task 3: Convection-Diffusion Equation

In the first task, I delve into the Convection-Diffusion Equation. Using the Finite Element Method, I simulate the behavior of this equation,
which appears in numerous areas of science and engineering, to understand how it describes the combined effects of convection and diffusion.


### Task 4: Rayleigh-Bénard Convection

In the final task, I dive into the fascinating phenomenon of Rayleigh-Bénard convection. By employing the Finite Element Method,
I simulate the convective heat transfer in a fluid layer, understanding its patterns and transitions. This task is particularly relevant to fluid dynamics and geophysics.
